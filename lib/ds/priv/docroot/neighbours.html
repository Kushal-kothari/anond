      <strong>Neighbouring nodes</strong><br/>
      This graph shows which nodes each node has chosen for its
      neighbours. The links between nodes are bi-directed if two nodes
      have chosen each other as neighbours and the number on each link
      is the average ping time between the nodes. Click on one or
      several nodes to show only their neighbours and double click to
      deselect. Incoming dashed links between nodes means that
      another node has chosen that node as a neighbour.
