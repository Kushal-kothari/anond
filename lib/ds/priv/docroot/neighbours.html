      <strong>Neighbouring nodes</strong><br/>
      This graph shows all node neighbour relationship. The links
      between nodes are bi-directed if two nodes have chosen each
      other as neighbours and the number on each link is the average
      ping time between the nodes. Click on one or several nodes to
      show only their neighbours and double click to deselect. A
      dashed link means that a node has been chosen as a neighbour
      node.<br>
