      <strong>Routes between nodes</strong><br/>
      This graph shows how nodes reache each other via intermediate
      nodes (or directly). A uniquely colored curve depicts the unique
      route between nodes. Click on one or several nodes to show only
      their chosen routes and double click to deselect. At times
      routes will overlap completely and thus make it hard to identify
      colouring; in that case try to drag the nodes about to lighten
      up the tight spot of routes.
