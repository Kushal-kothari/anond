# The DS JSON-RPC server

## 1) Overview

The directory server JSON-RPC server (from now on called server)
publish a number of methods to be used by nodes in order for them to
be a part of an anond overlay network. It provides the central
functionality provided by the *Public Directory Server* (DS) refered
to in [Anonymous overlay network supporting authenticated
routing](Schlegel-Wong-3.pdf).

The following methods are currently made available:

* `publish-node`
* `unpublish-node`
* `still-published-nodes`
* `get-random-nodes`
* `reserve-oa`
* `get-network-topology` (experimental)

The server conforms to the [JSON-RPC 2.0
Specification](http://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) and uses HTTP
over SSL as its transport mechanism.

All incoming HTTP requests to the server must be signed using a
[keyed-hash message authentication code
(HMAC)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash-based_message_authentication_code).
To bootstrap the HMAC signing scheme each node initially publish its
public signing key with a non-signed call to the `publish-node` method.

The result returned from this call is a unique `node-id` (and more)
and the node must send it along with each HTTP request its sends to
the server as a `Node-ID` HTTP header. After this call the DS knows
about the assocation between a specific `node-id` and its public
signing key.

From here on the node must sign all HTTP requests it sends to the
server and to do this it calculates a HMAC from the hashed body of the
HTTP request and sends this HMAC along with the HTTP request as a
base64 encoded `Content-HMAC` HTTP header. 

There is more to this. Please read on.

## 2) The JSON-RPC methods

In this section each server method's input parameters and the result
it produces are specified using [JSON schemas](http://json-schema.org).

### 2.1) Method: *publish-node*

#### Params:

```json

    "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-03/schema#",

            suitable for a signature scheme based on Curve25519 in

                use to identify itself. If a node specify these HTTP
                headers the `node-id` will be the same as specified in
                the 'Node-ID' header.",

                call to the `publish-node` method and is then provided
                with a new shared stream key but it also has the
                opportunity to renegotiate a new public signing key
                with the DS. Note: If a node has forgotten its secret
                signing key (the companion to the public signing key)
                it has to call `publish-node` again without any
                'Content-HMAC' and 'Node-ID' HTTP headers in the HTTP
                request, i.e. and it will get a new `node-id`. The old
                `node-id` will not be given to any other node until a
                server defined grace period has passed (~two weeks).",
            "type": "number",
            "minimum": 900000
        }
    }
}
```

#### Example:

First we generate a set of signing keys:

```
$ bin/anond -j public.key secret.key
$ cat public.key 
3blk9A8phCDzF3JoM4WNAZTVzOH0x2FWUU3v4yCJe/0=
$ cat secret.key 
egH7VZb4rxu03BFWPWfuYeXJQepZxwT5SRKA1+ahjnrduWT0DymEIPMXcmgzhY0BlNXM4fTHYVZRTe/jIIl7/Q==
```

First we isssue a initial non-signed call to the `publish-node` method
without and `Node-ID` or `Content-HMAC` HTTP headers:

```
$ curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -k -X POST -d '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "publish-node", \
"params": {"public-key": "3blk9A8phCDzF3JoM4WNAZTVzOH0x2FWUU3v4yCJe/0="}, "id": 1}' \
https://127.0.0.1:6700/jsonrpc
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": {
    "ds-id": 472742719,
    "node-id": 12,
    "shared-key": "lyKwRDcabkmoa2IqfeaTHMdTzJDKokx0aVlE8bfFeU4=",
    "node-ttl": 10800000
  },
  "id": 1
```

In return we got a unique `node-id` and a `shared-key`.

Next we call 'publish-node' again in order to get a new `shared-key`:

```
$ echo -n '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "publish-node", "params": {"public-key": \
"3blk9A8phCDzF3JoM4WNAZTVzOH0x2FWUU3v4yCJe/0="}, "id": 1}' > http_request.body 
$ bin/anond -l secret.key http_request.body

U33sR0pDJgFgWD2/Olrc/wjtQb7b1/bFJArWn+Scbin4mvKneB2m8UAzEC4NCFxlHF/8=
$ curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Node-ID: 12" -H "Content-HMAC: \

vruU33sR0pDJgFgWD2/Olrc/wjtQb7b1/bFJArWn+Scbin4mvKneB2m8UAzEC4NCFxlHF/8=" -k -X POST -d \
'{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "publish-node", "params": {"public-key": \
"3blk9A8phCDzF3JoM4WNAZTVzOH0x2FWUU3v4yCJe/0="}, "id": 1}' https://127.0.0.1:6700/jsonrpc
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": {
    "ds-id": 472742719,
    "node-id": 12,
    "shared-key": "t8ieEJrAwbhgObSRGWbiULYxgWB6XaeEVIEa4mg0R2A=",
    "node-ttl": 10800000
  },
  "id": 1
}
```

We got a new `shared-key` back. We could have specified a new
`public-key` as well in order to renegotiare a new public signing key
but this is left out as a excercise for the reader.
