N = Next thing to do
* = ?
L = Later

Documentation
-------------
N Update get-network-topology in udp-message-protocol.md
N Cleanup of udp-message-protocol.md
N Document Node-Node bit protocol in udp-message-protocol.md
N Write json-rpc-protocol.md

Directory server
----------------
* Make it possible to register a "domain"-name for a bunch of overlay
  adresses. The registration could be done through the directory
  server. Name lookups could be done towards a UDP based overlay
  service.

Node
----
N Integrate Patrik's psp code and authentication of path costs code
* Many oas per na (add random generation of oas as an alternative to
  static as well)
N Start a node->node keepalive in node_send_server.erl
* Limit download and upload rate in kB/s
* Use many overlay addresses and pick new ones now and then
* Pick new neighbour nodes now and then when needed(TM)
* Min acceptable neigbours, striving for wanted number of neighbours (bleed?)
* unestablish_tunnels() needed?
* Split up large route entries in smaller cells
* Add static floating number multiplicators for path costs for each node
* Only send route entries to a neighbour if the path cost to the
  neighbour itself or the path costvto the via node changes the total
  path cost more than 20%?

d3.js
-----
* Try to normalize the path-cost <-> pixel resolution (65533 is the
  max path cost)

DNS
---
* Investigate how to intercept DNS traffic (port 53) on the end-user
  machine using something such as https://gnunet.org/book/export/html/1631 and
  http://blog.listincomprehension.com/2010/07/dns-programming-with-erlang.html.

Hardware setup
--------------
N Buy a really big machine with 128GB RAM and setup 50 Ubuntu
  servers. Run a bittorrent tracker on one of them and let the rest of
  them download/seed files.

Tuncer
------
L Do some work on tunctl/procket, i.e. add ioctl calls for all
  "ifconfig" calls to remove the need to give root access to beam.smp,
  e.g. it should be enough use setcap on Linux.
L Make tuncer:read/2 work. It is broken now and I have to get IP
  packets as messages from the TUN device.
L Make it run on Windows

Misc
----
L Write documentation (Use LyX)
  - A White paper (Use Lyx)
  - Protocol design (UDP messaging and json-rpc)
  - End-user guide (for client and server users)
* Ask Per to contribute the delayed start patch to the Erlang distro.
L Add package management/installers for (the rest has to use compile
  from source):
  - Ubuntu
  - Mac
  - Windows
L Setup a nice anond site
L Implement anond control panels for:
  - GTK
  - Mac
  - Windows
